<h3>Solve crossword entries</h3>
<p>
    Set the number of letters in the word you are looking for using the
    dropdown. If the slots won't fit on the screen, rotate the phone so
    they will. The letter slots will scroll sideways. The longest word
    in the dictionary is antidisestablishmentarianism, which is 28
    letters. Even if 28 slots won't fit on the screen, the app should
    still find this word.
</p>
<p>
    Fill in the letters you have in the slots. As each letter is entered
    the next slot will be selected and the app will search for
    words. You can also use the keyboard
    <b>Next</b>
    button or
    the
    <b>Search</b>
    button to search. A stop character may
    be used as a wildcard.
</p>
<p>
    A list of matching words will appear below. If you select a word in
    the list, the slots will be filled in with that word, and a new
    screen will show a web search for the definition of the word
    on<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>. You may select
    links on the page and navigate back using the
    <b>Home</b>
    button
    on the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
    There are three icons in the toolbar,<b>Anagram</b>, which will
    show the anagram screen,<b>Help</b>, which will show the help
    screen, and<b>About</b>, which will show the copyright, licence and
    version.
</p>
<h3>Solve anagrams</h3>
<p>
    Type in the word or phrase you want anagrams for, and use the
    keyboard
    <b>Search</b>
    button or the
    <b>Search</b>
    button to
    search. The search may take a while, depending on the length of the
    phrase. During the search the
    <b>Search</b>
    button is disabled. The
    anagram search uses a smaller 58,000 word dictionary to reduce the
    search time, and because the larger dictionary contains a large
    number of not very useful three and four letter words and acronyms.
</p>
<p>
    Touch any blank area on the display to select all of the input
    field, so further input will replace it. Don't enter anything other
    than letters and blanks or the search will fail.
</p>
<p>
    A list of anagrams will appear below, sorted in reverse order of
    value, derived from Scrabble letter values. If you select an entry
    in the list, the entry will be copied to the input field and a new
    screen will show a web search for the definition of the entry
    on<a href="https://duckduckgo.com">DuckDuckGo</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This anagram algorithm is intended as a useful additional function
    to the crossword clue search, but is in no way comprehensive. Use
    one of the online anagram sites, such as
    at
    <a href="https://wordsmith.org/anagram/">Wordsmith.org</a>
    for a
    more comprehensive search.
